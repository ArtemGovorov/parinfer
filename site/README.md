# Parinfer Site

This is the home page for [Parinfer], intended to communicate the value of
Parinfer through animated and interactive demos, and to show a detailed
exploration of its concepts.

[Parinfer]:http://shaunlebron.github.io/parinfer/

We use [CodeMirror] for the demos, which is connected to the Parinfer library
through the code [here][editor-support].
